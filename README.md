# SalesBook - Recruitment Task.

## Introduction
This app is fully written in Swift language using UIKit. \n

I used MVVM architecture for the first time. I decided to use it, because it is one of the best architecture for bigger projects. I know that this project is not a big one yet, but who knows how will it change in the future. \n

The project is based on the API: https://exchangeratesapi.io/ which allows to download the currency data in many configurations.
